# Project Name

**Author**: Kerry Nordstrom and Jeff Kusowski
**Version**: 1.0.7

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
1. We forked the lab 08 repo for this lab into Jeff's GitHub account. Jeff created a new branch and we started out with Kerry navigating and Jeff driving. When we switched roles during pair programming, Kerry fetched the working branch and pulled down the changes.
2. We first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Next we worked on going through each of the todo and comment sections and completing the todo's and commenting as necessary.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and search for todos, comments and reviews in the project.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The focus of this lab was explaining the CRUD operations as communicated between user client, server controller, and database model.  We used ExpressJS to simplify this process.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

11-2-2017 9:00am - Begin lab with Jeff driving and Kerry navigating.  Began working through todos.

11-2-2017 10:15am - Kerry drove and Jeff navigated.  We tackled most of the comments which explained the CRUD operations.

11-2-2017 12noon - Jeff drove and Kerry navigated as we wrote the README.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Created by Kerry Nordstrom and Jeff Kusowski. Based off of the starter code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. Using jQuery, Handlebars, highlighting.js, marked.js, and ExpressJS libraries.
